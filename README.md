### Welcome to my profile ðŸ‘‹

I'm `Kilian SMITI`, a french developer passionate about web technologies since his childhood. I started building websites when I was ten year old and I decided to make it my job.

Currently, I'm `Full-Stack Developer` for `Free (Iliad)` ðŸš€, one of the main French telecommunications operators. I work on many internal applications, whether it is on invoicing tools, or civil engineering management tools, I have no trouble getting to grips with a subject.

You can find more information about me and my parkour on my [portfolio](https://doplex.fr).
